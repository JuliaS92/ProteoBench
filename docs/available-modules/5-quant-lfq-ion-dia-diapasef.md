# DIA quantification - ion level - diaPASEF

This module compares the sensitivity and quantification accuracy for data acquired with data-independent acquisition (DIA) on a timsTOF (Bruker).
It is similar to the DIA quantification module "ion-level" described [here](https://proteobench.readthedocs.io/en/stable/available-modules/4-quant-lfq-ion-dia-aif).

**We are currently generating the data. More to come soon.**
