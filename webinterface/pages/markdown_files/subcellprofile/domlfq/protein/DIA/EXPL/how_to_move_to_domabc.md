You can download here the results of this analysis and visualise them more in depth in the [DOM-ABC web application](https://domqc.bornerlab.org/NMCComp). You can then explore more in depth your analysis results, as presented in [Schessner et al. (Nature Communications, 2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41000-7).

The domaps analysis is already performed so you can directly go to the `Benchmark` tab. 

1. Click on `Choose file` and select the .json from ProteoBench
2. Check the box corresponding to your data point
3. Press `Align and analyse selected datasets` 

You can then explore your data more in depth, and visualise the results for each cluster independently (in the `intramap scatter` tab).
